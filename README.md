Translucence and Pearlescence in betta fish
===============

Hello! Thank you for all the support and feedback for our betta fish project.

The majority of the final work is in scenes/blender, where you will also find the final .blend file. You can also see experiments we did with materials in pbrt in src/materials/fish and src/materials/newt, as well as some rendered images the the scenes folder. In the home directory, we have our final presentation pdf, final writeup, and the project proposal.

Thank you for a great quarter, we learned so much!
